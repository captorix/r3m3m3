# S3F3: Liquid Staking Platform for M3M3


## Overview

S3F3 is a liquid staking platform built on the innovative M3M3 mechanism by Meteora AG. It allows users to stake any amount of $M3M3 tokens and earn rewards without top limits.

With S3F3, you can stake your M3M3 tokens and receive Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) that mirror your staked assets. These LSTs are fully tradable and backed by your staked M3M3, offering a powerful combination: enjoy staking rewards while maintaining liquidity.

Feel free to use this code for your own projects.
